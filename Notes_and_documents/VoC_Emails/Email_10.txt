Dear Fitness Retail Team,

I recently purchased the PulseFit Tracker 2 (FIT-601) for $129.99, hoping to track my steps and heart rate accurately. Unfortunately, it arrived with a dead battery, and even after charging, the tracker frequently loses connection with my phone. The instructions were confusing, and customer support has been slow to respond.

I expected better quality and reliability from your brand, especially for a premium-priced wearable. Honestly, this purchase has been frustrating, and I’m reconsidering whether I’ll buy anything from your store again.

Disappointed,
