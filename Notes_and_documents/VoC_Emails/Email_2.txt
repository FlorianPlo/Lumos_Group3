Dear Fitness Retail Team,

I purchased a CoreBalance Yoga Mat (FIT-301) for $34.99, and I was charged $50.00 for shipping to Outland Point. $50 for a $35 yoga mat?! It arrived in a box large enough to fit a TV. The shipping cost more than the item itself!

This is outrageous. I am returning this item immediately, and this will be my first and last order from your company. I strongly suggest reviewing your shipping policies.

Angrily,
