Dear Fitness Retail Team,

I’m writing to express my extreme frustration regarding my recent purchase of the ProTread X1000 treadmill (FIT-101) for $1,499.99. I paid $300 for shipping to the Isle of Skye, which I thought was steep but acceptable.

However, upon delivery, I noticed the commercial shipping manifest left on the box clearly shows your actual cost was $825.00! Are you seriously scamming customers, or are you just losing a fortune on shipping? Either way, this is completely unacceptable and makes me question ever ordering from you again. I demand an explanation immediately.

Sincerely,
