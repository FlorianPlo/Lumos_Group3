HR Internal Report: Employee Feedback Summary – Branding & Marketing

Prepared by: Human Resources – Engagement & Culture
Period covered: Annual Employee Satisfaction Survey (Branding/Marketing Focus)

Overview

As part of this year’s engagement review, employees were invited to provide input on the company’s visual identity, brand messaging, and customer-facing design materials. Responses were generally thoughtful and constructive, reflecting interest in strengthening how our brand is perceived externally.

Employees expressed a consistent desire for clearer brand cohesion, more distinctive visual elements, and more varied marketing messaging.

Current Marketing & Branding Approach (Observational Summary)

Our current brand identity emphasizes general fitness lifestyle themes and utilizes broad stock-imagery aesthetics. While this approach is flexible and cost efficient, several outcomes have been observed:

Brand Familiarity: The imagery and message style blend into a crowded fitness market where many competitors use similar visual language.

Tone Variability: Campaigns shift between high-performance athlete messaging and casual home wellness, which can dilute identity consistency.

Content Repetition: Email and social media messaging often reuses similar slogans, photography, and layout patterns, potentially reducing engagement over time.

Product Visual Consistency: Packaging and product photography vary in lighting style, background color, and typeface usage, leading to small but noticeable visual mismatches across categories.

These observations do not imply any failure in execution — rather, they suggest that our brand identity may be entering a natural "maturity plateau," where small refreshes could restore differentiation and customer attention.

Selected Anonymous Employee Comments

(Presented verbatim as part of transparency in reporting)

“The new logo isn’t bad, but it feels a bit generic. When I show friends where I work, the reaction is usually ‘looks like any fitness company.’ I think we lost some uniqueness.”

“Our website layout is clean, but some product images look stretched or inconsistent. It makes the store feel less professional than it could.”

“I don’t really understand what our brand message is supposed to be. Sometimes we push ‘performance athlete’ and other times ‘casual home fitness.’ A clearer direction would help everyone.”

“Marketing emails go out pretty often, but they start to feel repetitive. Same phrases, similar pictures…it’s easy for customers to tune out.”

“I actually really like the new instructional workout videos. They feel more approachable and realistic than heavily staged ads.”

“Packaging looks fine, but some of the color choices clash. When items are displayed together, there isn’t a consistent visual identity. It would be great if everything felt more coordinated.”

“Appreciate that we’re trying new social media formats. The shorter tutorial clips seem to get better engagement than the long, polished promo ads.”
