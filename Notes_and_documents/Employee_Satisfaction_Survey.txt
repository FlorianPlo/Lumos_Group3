Some feedback referenced challenges associated with transitions between busier and slower operational cycles.

Employees noted appreciation for predictable schedules but highlighted occasional mismatches between staffing levels and workload volume.

Routine maintenance and space organization activities are more common during lighter operational periods.

Selected Anonymous Comments: (representative, not exhaustive)

“January was extremely busy this year. I felt like we were constantly trying to catch up on order fulfillment, and a few extra hands would have helped reduce the strain.”

“A lot of us worked long shifts during the peak rush. I understand it’s part of the business cycle, but the overtime felt a bit heavy this time around.”

“We’ve dealt with post-holiday spikes every year, so it’s not unexpected. Just feels like we could plan staffing a little earlier before things pile up.”

“Once we moved past the busy months, the warehouse got really quiet. Some days it’s hard to find tasks that feel meaningful.”

“There are times in the fall where we’re mostly maintaining the space and doing general upkeep. It’s fine, but it can feel repetitive.”

“On slower weeks, it seems like we have more people scheduled than the workload requires. Not sure if there’s room to adjust that.”
