SUBJECT: LOCKED: Our 2023 Marketing Plan - "Project Get-Big"

Team,

We had a killer Q4 and 2022 was huge, but now we need to ACT big. I've approved the budget for our 2023 marketing push, codenamed "Project Get-Big." Our goal is to triple our brand presence and become a household name.

Here are the four pillars we're funding:

1.  **"Go Viral" TikTok Challenge:** We need to be where the kids are. We'll launch the #ZenithActiveChallenge. I want everyone to post videos of themselves using our gear. Marketing, get a hashtag figured out and let's get this thing trending. The KPI is views and shares.

2.  **Email Acquisition:** We've secured a 500,000-person "Fitness Enthusiast" email list. We're going to hit them with a "Welcome to the Family" 10% off coupon. Let's send this blast out weekly to the whole list to maximize conversions.

3.  **Local "Tombstone" Presence:** I've signed the 1-year contract for the billboard on I-95, about 15 miles from the warehouse. It's going to feature the ProTread X1000. This is huge for local brand awareness and will look amazing.

4.  **Social Media Dominance:** We're upping the social budget. I want every single post on Instagram and Facebook boosted with at least $50. Let's flood the feed and get those follower counts up. I want to hit 100k followers by EOY.

This is the plan. Let's get it done.
