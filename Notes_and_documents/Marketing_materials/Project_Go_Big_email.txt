Hi Mark,

Following up on our H1 performance for "Project Get-Big." We're seeing some massive numbers!

Here are the high-level KPIs as requested:

* **TikTok Challenge:** The #ZenithActiveChallenge hashtag has generated over **250,000 views**! We're really getting our name out there. (Note: Sales attribution is difficult to track here, but the brand awareness is huge).

* **Email Blasts:** We have successfully sent **12.5 million emails** (500k list x 25 weeks). Open rates are stable at 1.5%. The 10% off coupon code "GETBIG10" has been used 850 times, generating $120,000 in gross revenue!

* **Billboard:** The billboard is up and looks amazing. I've attached a photo. Everyone at the warehouse loves it.

* **Social Followers:** Our boosted-post strategy is working. Our Instagram follower count is up **45%** since January! Likes and impressions are through the roof.

Overall, "Project Get-Big" is really succeeding in growing our presence. We're on track to hit our follower goals.

Thanks,
Brad
