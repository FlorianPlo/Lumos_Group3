SUBJECT: URGENT: Margin Analysis of "GETBIG10" Coupon Code

Hi Sarah,

I was running our mid-year profitability analysis and found something you need to see.

I isolated the 850 redemptions from the "GETBIG10" coupon (from Brad's H1 report) and cross-referenced them with our logistics and product cost data.

The results are not good.

* This campaign (targeting the purchased email list) seems to be attracting customers in high-cost, remote shipping zones.
* The 10% discount is being disproportionately applied to our *highest-cost* items.
* **Over 30% of the sales (255 orders) generated by this code were *net-negative* on profit.**
* We lost over **$15,000** on a campaign that generated $120,000 in revenue. The 10% discount *plus* our high shipping costs to these new customers means we paid them to take our products.

We are actively losing money with this "Project Get-Big" initiative. Can we please pause all broad, un-targeted discounting until we can build a proper profitability model?

Let me know if you want the full spreadsheet.

Best,
Susan
